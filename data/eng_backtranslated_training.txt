I would like to show this by examining the main issues .
Further criticism was put on the other presidential candidates .
Foreign commentators are guilty of many shortcomings .
The country has a history of discrimination and violence .
I would like to show this through a quick examination of the main issues .
The debate about the country’s leadership has been conducted earlier .
It is hard to have children concentrate in online classes .
The National Revolutionary Movement for Development had been removed .
It chose to stick to harmony and lead the formation of national unity .
These steps were taken to build a system based on oneness politics .
It had no plan of choking other actors and occupying political space .
It chose to ignore popular opinion together with other parties .
Use history to build a functioning multi-party system .
The meetings have been held online .
The objective is to fake unity about how to move forward .
What happened in the political arena as a result of unity among the elites .
Admittedly some have fled over the years .

Recently ,  other political groups have fulfilled the strict requirements .
Political groups have been registered as political parties ,  now they are ten .
It is split into competing groups .
As a result ,  he could not contest in the presidential elections .
Two other groups are seeking to register .
Popular media have decided to label these three parties .
They have failed to ask whether the decision is permanent or uncertain .
The country has a functioning and state-funded forum of political parties .
All registered parties ,  with or without representation in parliament ,  participate .
Its aim was to ensure that parties without representation have their own space .
It shall make their views on important issues known to Parliament .
Until two thousand six ,  political parties were stopped from opening branches .
Nor do they bother with another supposed fact .
Today ,  one can see party flags flying high at local offices .
The party flags are a sure sign of grassroots party activity .
I have run into them in academic forums ,  across the globe .
There are three things to remember here .
The party's control by the state entered every aspect of people’s lives .
It had a victory and an army that had come to be viewed as strong .
Its members fled before the eyes of the people they controlled for so long .
The country’s recent history renders the notable sign of fear expected .
The country has been engulfed with fear .
His house was misplaced among the multi-roomed properties behind the high fences .
A house is the dream of almost every adult Ugandan .
Up to fifty-eight percent rent and the rent in Uganda is very high .
Only twenty-seven percent rent main house units .
Rent goes for far less as one moves away from prime locations .
However ,  rent is still higher than elsewhere in the region .
That is where the desire to own a house starts .
This method is laughed at as old-fashioned .
Real estate developers want income earners to run to the bank for a mortgage .
One buys the plot and builds at their pace without pressure .
The downside is that few people can raise the cash required to put up a house .
The build and sell section of the housing sector had seen major growth .
The unreasonably high prices have created a surplus over the period .

Most of them are self-employed .

Police abuse in Kenya has shown a significant increase over the years .
Police abuse has become worse in Nairobi .
An increase in police harassment has been documented .
Police officers habitually raid houses and execute random arrests .
Police misconduct in Kenya is not exceptional .
Police misconduct is structural and a part of everyday policing .
Police misconduct realization is far from recent .
There are ongoing efforts to transform the Kenyan police .
The researcher interviewed police officers stationed in various parts of Nairobi .
Police misconduct had become part of everyday police work .
Research shows that the problem lies with police cultures .
In some police forces ,  certain attitudes condone various forms of misconduct .
There is a sense of impunity in certain cultures .
Some police officers saw misconduct as part of their work .
Other officers feared to speak out against their colleagues .
New structures and laws have been introduced as a measure for police misconduct .
The objective is to create a democratic and accountable police service that is not politicized .
Police reform was a crucial part of a program under President Mwai Kibaki .
Initiatives were designed to transform the security and justice sector .
The state police have been viewed as an instrument for control .
A task force on reform was founded by the state police .
It was an encompassing and ambitious reform program .
The reform program did not lead to substantial changes .
Police were deeply implicated after the presidential elections .
A large number of people died as a result of police actions .
Concrete legislative changes followed after the death of people .
The National Police Service Act was first published in the year two thousand eleven .
Transforming the police force into police service resulted in a wide range of changes .
Changes were centered towards collaboration and better service .
The internal affairs unit was set up under the National Police Service set .
The internal unit handles police misconduct internally .
The unit will receive and investigate complaints against police officers .
Antonio Guterres is the Sustainable Development Goals Advocate for the United Nations Secretary-General .
The Independent Policing Oversight Authority was established .
The authority is required to investigate police misconduct .
There are two oversight bodies .
Added to these were a range of other initiatives .
There are social justice groups ,  along with several other human rights organizations .
Despite all these efforts ,  police brutality continues .
The answer lies with the police themselves as my research found .
Speaking out can lead to isolation and exclusion .
It can also result in the denial of promotions or outright punishment .
Another factor ,  solidarity seems to have been in play too .
The Independent Policing Oversight Authority survey also reported .
The answer to ending police brutality therefore largely lies with the police themselves .
Officers need to realize that police violence is outright bad policing .
To achieve this ,  a change in mindset needs to happen .
This needs external support ,  from donors and civil society ,  for example .
And it can be guided by additional monitoring .
Yet the change essentially needs to be driven from within .
Police officers need to begin to see police misconduct as detrimental ,  rather than beneficial .
It can be promoted by revamped training curricula .
Tessa Diphoorn is Assistant Professor ,  Utrecht University .
He later said that more people are being able to share their perspectives .
The speech anointed Facebook as the "Fifth Estate" .
The platform Zuckerberg created does more than give people a voice ,  bringing them together .
It is economically incentivized to drive people apart .
In the process ,  it shatters an underpinning of democracy .
From broadcasting to target casting .
Maximizing revenue from advertising meant offending as few readers as possible .
The targeting capability of social media algorithms .
Now profit comes not through the broad delivery of common information .
The result is an attack on the model of shared information .
Radio and television are broadcasting from a single source .
Broadcasting changed the nature of communications .
The image of a family huddling around the radio Facebook Chairperson .
Can the two coexist given that shared not targeted is necessary ?
Cable television is narrowcasting .
To differentiate themselves on this newsstand ,  cable news channels developed an attitude .
Narrowcasting was driven by conflict and disagreement .
Social media is target casting .
They then sell advertisers the ability to reach those groups .
Target Casting companies make money the opposite way .
Instead of selling ,  reach out to a wider audience .
An even greater differentiator between traditional media and social media
Such a secret targeting tears at the fabric of democracy .
They began the constitution with the collective "We the people" .
To become "We" requires a suspension of human nature's tribal instincts .
Such a belief is predicated in part on shared information .
Coming together in an environment of shared information .
When algorithms of social media follow the money ,  they undermine the communal "We" .
They gnaw away at the heart of "We the people" balance and transparency .
Congress acted to assure conflicting ideas had access to the airwaves .
Following World War two's example of radio being used to manipulate the German population .
Assuring the widest possible dissemination of political viewpoints .
Cable television came along expanding rapidly in the seventies and eighties .
What's more ,  because cable channels did not use the public's airwaves .
The ability to change the channel to discover a different point of view .
The algorithms of social media do not provide such an open opportunity .
There is no channel dial to turn for another opinion .
This is because of the network effects enjoyed by social media .
Once locked into this network ,  the algorithms then do their target casting in secret .
The Federal Communication Commission requires that all broadcast advertising declare who is paying it .
We can choose among print publications as well as broadcast for different editorial positions .
The editorial position of traditional media is openly obvious simply by reading or watching .
Such secrecy and closed control of information options inherently work at cross purposes .
A lie can get halfway around the world before the truth gets its boots on .
Targeted data circles the world at lightning speed .
What do we do now ?
The result was a surge in right-wing talk radio .
Today ,  Democratic Federal Communications Commission nominees go through the confirmation process .
Currently ,  however ,  Republicans also seem focused on the allegations .
President Trump has even threatened to instruct the Federal Communications Commission .
First Amendment protections against government interference ,  of course ,  are predominant in any situation .
The broadcast rule was held by the supreme court .
But that does not mean other alternatives aren't available .
Disclosing who pays for the message is one alternative .
Senators have proposed legislation to require disclosure of the sponsor of social media advertisements .
It has gone nowhere in the senate .
I have previously proposed removing the secrecy through a Public Interest .
We have a long way to go on this issue .
I understand the concerns about how tech platforms have centralized power .
Social media has ,  indeed ,  changed the way people create information .
But platforms such as Facebook have also changed how people consume content .
Openness and transparency must come to social media
Target casting should not destroy foundational elements of our democracy

Talking about young Africans using smartphones .
Social Media takes pride of place in that description ,  despite their murkier side .
What has perhaps been overlooked ?
One area is the ever-growing community of sports betting in Africa .
The phenomenon of sports betting among African youths has taken the region by storm .
Recent polls and anecdotal reports point to a grim scenario ,  especially in Sub-Saharan Africa .
African youths between seventeen and thirty-five years have engaged in sports gambling .
Kenya ,  with seventy-four percent participation in sports betting .
The Survey of some two thousand seven hundred twenty-six African millennials was conducted .
A core driver of this trend has been the growing ubiquity of mobile telephony .
Added to this has been greater connectivity including satellite access to sports matches .
Sports betting has brought many ills to young people in Sub-Saharan Africa .
For an external and independent oversight .
There are deaths and serious injuries caused by police .
The oversight bodies ensure those police officers are monitored in their everyday affairs .
These initiatives include; police officer vetting and the revamping of a community policing program .
The Police Reform Working Group supported many of these attempts at police reform .
Several police officers said they were scared to speak out for fear of repercussions .
It can result in being transferred to a hardship area .
Police officers often cover for each other when involved in crime .
From the level of top leadership to the constable stationed at the charge office .
It is being enforced by both oversight bodies .
It essentially demands inspirational leadership that penalizes misconduct and sends a signal to all officers .
The conversation by Tom Wheeler Speaking recently at Georgetown University .
He added that it has always been necessary to build a more inclusive society .
People no longer rely on traditional gatekeepers to make their voices heard .
The economic incentive has worked to bring people together .
At least attempting a balanced presentation of the facts .
The economic model of maximizing revenue by maximizing reach is still governed .
Social media algorithms have extinguished the traditional economic model .
The profit comes from the targeted delivery of selected information .
It is necessary for a democracy to function .
Radio and television deliver to the widest possible audience .
Communications changed from after-the-fact newspapers to the wide distribution of real-time information .
Mark Zuckerberg addresses the audience on the challenges of protecting free speech .
Cable is like a video newsstand with many titles from which to choose .
The revenue-maximizing goal was still the same as broadcasters .
Software algorithms are owned by social media platforms .
They charge a premium to target a small but specifically defined group .
Target casting is available only to a specific audience .
Such a coming together ,  the Founders realized
An information commons- is a key component of moving from tribes to the larger Unum .
The algorithms keep users online for as long as possible ,  maximizing ad sales .
There was a concern that broadcasting could be captured to become an anti-democratic force .
The Federal Communications Commission used its congressionally delegated authority to impose Fairness Doctrine rules .
Television providers could target specific interests with specialized channels .
The airwaves weren't subject to balance requirements set by the Federal Communication Commission's rules .
The ability to change the channel remained freely available .
An open opportunity to find differing points of view .
We go to the social media sites with the most users .
It also promotes the propagation of questionable information .
The speed of twenty-first-century information dissemination makes this maxim quaint .
Misinformation is aided by corporate algorithms programmed to maximize profit instead of open information .
The Federal Communications Commission's Fairness Doctrine was eliminated during the Reagan administration .
Republican members of the Senate still try to extract a commitment to not reinstate .
The allegations are on the left-leaning information choices made by social media platforms .
The Federal Trade Commission is to investigate the editorial decisions of the social media companies .
It was the public's airwaves .
What is going into and out of social media algorithms ?
Perhaps Mr .  Zuckerberg's speech gets the final word at this point .
I believe the much bigger story is how much these platforms have decentralized power .
Corporate algorithms are now the "centralized power" in control of that consumption .
The dominant narrative is that these gadgets serve mostly as platforms for connection .
Smartphones are also affecting other facets of young people's lives .
Kenya had by far the largest percentage of youth involvement in this activity .
Around the continent combined with the availability of smartphones .
There is a ballooning population of young people with high levels of unemployment .
The authority conducts inspections of police premises .
Mark Zuckerberg is focused on giving people a voice ,  and bringing people together .
A forum was hosted by Georgetown University's institute at Politics and Public Service .
How users behave online and use that data to categorize them into specific groups .
The Founders realized it was essential for their experiment in democracy to function .
When the communal "We" is undermined they deliver different information to tribes in secret .
Broadcasting began in the twenties and thirties
The Fairness Doctrine rules were imposed on broadcasters requiring the airing of all sides .
On the social media sites with most users ,  that's where our friends are .
The public had a right to assure they weren't misused .
These platforms are putting decentralized power directly into people's hands .
Users can communicate and share greetings and information via text messages .

In return ,  the Ugandan leadership views Kagame as resilient .
The Daily Monitor newspaper in Kampala in December twenty eighteen quoted Kagame .
Those challenges have been changing forms .
When it comes to us ,  our history ,  we do not take security challenges lightly .
We would not want to be found wanting in terms of taking care of our security .

Former Deputy Prime Minister ,  Henry Kajura is in financial trouble
Former politicians lose property to money lenders and banks for failure to pay loans .
It's shocking when a long-serving cabinet member loses a house due to debts .
Kajura isn't the only former politician to find himself in financial trouble .
There's a long list of politicians who move from cabinet/parliament to economic stress .
people see politicians as corrupt and therefore rich but this isn't always the case .
It is not true that every politician is financially stable .
The public misunderstands corruption by thinking all government officials are rich
People look at joining politics as a way of accumulating personal wealth .
Corruption is the way political power in poor countries is organized .
Corruption helps politicians build constituencies of support by accumulating quick wealth .
Politicians tighten their grip on power by constantly giving out money to their constituents .
We should understand how power is organized and exercised in a poor country .
Most African countries are ethnically and religiously diverse .
Many African countries are poor hence heavily dependent on Western financial assistance .
Religious and ethnic divisions create strong moral and psychological attachment identity among Africans
a political party must win over influential pillars of opinion in ethnic and religious groups
Powerful pillars of opinion include traditional leaders ,  successful businesspersons ,  and religious clerics
Religious leaders act as a bridge between the president and the religious community
Ugandans seeing their own in a high government office is an expression of their presence in government
power-sharing gives the people a sense of belonging to the nation
The president has over 100 presidential advisors
Patronage is used by Museveni to deprive the opposition of high profile individuals
opposition explains why it cannot find enough high profile individuals to field in parliamentary elections
Successful politicians are those who meet cultural obligations in their communities
Politicians meet their constituents financial needs by paying fees and medical bills for some
There is inequality of wealth and income in poor communities
politicians cultivate a political following by attending burial ceremonies
Most politicians use the personal income to meet their constituents financial needs
Politicians in control of the state use public funds to meet constituents financial needs
legislators are constantly met with demands for financial assistance from their poor constituents
Ordinary constituents have a concept that their legislator is a financial helper
Legislators are seen as rich and generous in rural communities .
Generosity takes a large share of a politician's income .
You have to share your wealth with people to succeed politically
Legislators are unable to meet individual constituent financial demands on their income .
The state cannot provide a large basket of public goods and services to constituents .
The resources available to the individual politician and to the state are different .
politicians borrow to endear themselves to voters by exhibiting exaggerated generosity
over half of our legislators have their salary cut to pay off their loans
Politicians expect to pay their loans through corruption on being appointed to cabinet
legislators get bribes from other thieving public officials in exchange for covering up their theft
We are deluded expecting parliament to act as a check on the executive
Not every legislator can be appointed to cabinet
Politics involves making risky bets when one takes a loan expecting a cabinet position
Those who lose elections find themselves unable to repay their debts hence bankruptcy
A president has to create opportunities for his party members to make money
A Minister is expected to help his constituents find jobs
Corruption is not an Africa only problem as western nations face it too
Governments in poor countries use corruption to consolidate power
read the history of Europe in the 19th century to learn about corruption
Corruption is the way the governance system works in Uganda
Politicians use corruption to build electoral and governing coalitions
We have criminalized ways of managing power relations in Uganda
Corruption is an obstacle to the development of a modern state
Historically corruption has not stopped economic development
Modern meritocratic states grow inside the womb of patrimonial ones
Economic growth and societal structural transformation change the old system of governance
A quick transformation to a modern meritocratic state is nearly impossible .
Revolutions don't always bring economic and social transformation as expected .
Uganda ,  Rwanda ,  and Burundi are experiencing tense political cross-border situations .
Uganda's military expenditure has exponentially increased in twenty-eighteen .
Branding a product made in Uganda doesn't necessarily mean it was made here .
Toxicities from phone batteries affect the livelihood of Ugandans
Uganda's first mobile factory is to provide more jobs for the youth
Economic development doesn't happen overnight so patience is key
The University council should work with students for the University to function to its best

The Mineral Development Beneficiation Center will be one of its kind in Ntungamo District
Many politicians go broke after leaving the cabinet
A president must win over powerful pillars of opinion in religious groups to keep in power
Tribal leaders can win favor amongst their communities for the ruling party
A power-sharing feeling is felt when a tribe has enough representation in government
Power-sharing legitimizes the state
Uganda has over two hundred forty Resident District Commissioners
Museveni uses high profile individuals to rally a mass political base
The opposition faces a big challenge of Museveni appointing most high profile individuals
Attending religious services and ceremonies is an effective way of rallying political support
Generous contributions to funerals and weddings are a way of gaining political support
Legislators find it hard to save as they're always financially assisting constituents
Ministers pay for constituents' expenses which result in corruption
The Ministry has a challenge of monitoring the proper disposal of phone batteries
Uganda has about one hundred and fifty semi-autonomous government agencies
Corrupt politicians remain popular because they share their "loot" with their co-ethnics
The politician helps people with personal needs like school fees ,  medical bills ,  and funerals .
Our politicians are always under enormous pressure to meet these needs .
This is because our voters do not distinguish .
Corruption is ,  therefore a forbidden practice .
Corrupt politicians who are generous in their ethnic or religious communities win elections .
People are even more willing to support one of their own .
Ethnic tensions undermine the rule of law .
India has the longest surviving democracy of any poor country in the world today .
Twenty percent of candidates for parliament were facing criminal charges .
This number has been growing at a rate of two percent in every election .
As a result ,  one-third of India's parliament is under criminal indictment .
The report said that the money had been embezzled .
Uganda is headed in the same direction as democratic competition deepens .
Over the last twenty-five years of electoral politics ,  we have seen honest politicians .
This is because they are not willing to dirty their hands looting the state .
The problem is that there are many crooks ready to join .
In rich countries ,  the private sector is rich enough to fund parties .
There are also many rich individuals and private organizations/foundations to do similar .
The private sector is small and most rich individuals are beholden to the state .
Therefore ,  the only reliable source of political money is corruption .
Consequently ,  corruption is not just a means for individual enrichment .
This is why we need to understand ,  even though we may refuse to endorse Museveni .
Our president moves with cash-stuffed envelopes ,  which he liberally hands over to people
The young Museveni would have been revolted by this crass bribery and political opportunism .
He has outlived many of his bush compatriots in large .
Many Ugandans accept his transformation with the humility of experience .
With this knowledge ,  we can craft a political model .
Most of the people who get elected to public office have little incentive .
Their success shows they are beneficiaries of the system .
It would literally be like asking them .
Money politics is not a cause of our poverty but a symptom of it .
It does not mean that we cannot outgrow it
The United States had a very corrupt political machine system .
The country remains saddled with a lot of political corruption .
Up until the end of the nineteenth century when America was poor and agrarian .
Early efforts to criminalize vote-buying in the United States of America were resisted .
Whichever political reform we attempt ,  it won't eliminate the centrality of money in politics .
It can only limit it with tradeoffs .
Will Durant ,  said there are only three successful forms of government known to man .
One way to limit vote-buying is to introduce proportional representation .
Here political parties ,  not individuals ,  would compete for votes .
Parliamentary seats would be allocated .
This system would reduce the incentive of individual politicians .
It would shift power from voters at the grassroots .
The jockeying for top slots on the list of parliamentarians would centralize corruption .
This would shift money from a multitude of voters .
Winnie ,  would you accept to be our candidate for President ?
His wife ,  Winnie Byanyima was surprised .
And the conversation soon became even more serious
Winnie said: "It would be suicidal" .
How would you take him on ?
I guess they are .
Days later ,  on October twentieth ,  two thousand ,  Besigye dropped another surprise on Winnie
Again she answered with a weighty caution
I will support you .
We are defying Museveni .
He is going to fight us to the end .
On October twenty-eighth ,  two thousand at a little known restaurant in Kampala .
Nineteen years later ,  Winnie appears to have been prophetic on both counts .
Secondly ,  Museveni and Besigye appear determined to "fight to the end"
Kalinaki published his book in two thousand fourteen .
The two thousand twenty-one presidential election nears .
And what will be the result ?
The document stirred divisions in the National Resistance Movement .
Dr .  Besigye criticized the creeping autocracy under President Yoweri Museveni .
Besigye started off writing that I have taken a keen interest and participated in politics .
I am ,  therefore ,  fully aware of the excitement which Uganda received .
Besigye accused the National Resistance Movement of sectarianism .
It culminated in his declaration to stand for the presidency .
Since the two thousand one election ,  Besigye has stood three more times against Museveni .
He has incurred the wrath of the National Resistance Movement regime with trials ,  teargas .
But two thousand nineteen marks thirty years since Besigye became disillusioned with Museveni .
The trigger appears to have been a decision in October .
The National Resistance Council had expanded its membership with two hundred twenty county representatives .
Some people did not support the Besigye campaigning during the two thousand sixteen elections .
Waswa Ziritwawula ,  a representative from the Democratic Party ,  resigned from the National Resistance Council .
Some people demanded a referendum on the issue .
However ,  bush war acolytes defied them ,  sometimes with threats .
Gertrude Njuba assured that the National Resistance Council was there .
Kalinaki wrote that the National Resistance Council was set up to formalize the decisions .
I could not see how we could make a transition with Museveni .
At a personal level that confidence had completely collapsed .
By that time I was convinced that there was corruption .
It only got worse .
But from that time ,  I knew we were in for a difficult time .
However ,  we could not even persuade anybody that there was a huge problem .
Many people had not awoken to the disaster that we were sitting with .
My mind was made up much earlier than we were heading for trouble .
Besigye initially sought to correct what he saw as going wrong .
On prompting Museveni's brother Salim Saleh he wrote a dossier .
In it he pointed issues that were ,  in his view ,  not being handled properly .
The issue of recruitment to and promotion within the army was contentious at the time .
Whether the money is stolen from the state or acquired honestly is irrelevant .
Voters don't distinguish between the private resources of a politician and the public finances .
People are even more willing to support that .
People think the corrupt steal for them .
These charges range from murder to rape and extortion .
Candidates with criminal records in India are three times more likely to win elections .
The honest politicians quit electoral competition or are trounced when they have tried .
The private sector is rich enough to fund individuals who represent its interests .
He stepped down from his revolutionary utopia to the hard rock of reality .
The model is to limit the role of money in politics .
It is like asking them to bite the hand that feeds their political success
The corrupt political-machine system has over decades improved albeit slowly .
A lot of political corruption has been legalized like lobbying .
Votes were sold in an open marketplace the way we buy tomatoes and beans .
We give up on democracy .
The three forms of government include aristocracy ,  theocracy ,  and democracy .
The parliamentary seats are allocated according to the share of votes a party got .
Individual politicians ingratiate themselves with voters by giving them money .
Power from voters is shifted at the grassroots to political party bosses .
Aspiring legislators would now bribe party bosses .
Money is shifted to a small group of party bigwigs .
Kizza Besigye posed that question sometime in early October two thousand .
I wouldn't do that !
Winnie countered that it takes some time to turn discontent into votes
I hope you realize that this is a one-way ticket .
The book is titled "Kizza Besigye: Uganda's Unfinished Revolution"
Besigye publicly declared his intention to challenge Museveni in a press statement .
He has challenged Museveni in four presidential elections over sixteen years .
The two thousand sixteen presidential battle between Museveni and Besigye already looming .
Most Ugandans are asking whether Besigye will again challenge Museveni for the fifth time .
This is the time when Besigye will finally succeed .
It was then known as the Movement .
Museveni was then in his thirteenth year in power having taken over Uganda .
I have participated in political activities on the Ugandan scene .
The dossier resulted in the court martialing of Besigye .
It culminated in his declaration in the two thousand one elections .
He also incurred constant arrests ,  torture ,  and blockades on his home .
They had not appointed the National Resistance Movement or its organs in the first place .
The National Resistance Council was set to formalize National Resistance Movement decisions .
There was no respect for the rules and plans we were making
Corruption scandals rocked the country .
Besigye sought to correct what was wrong within National Resistance Movement .
The dossier was addressed to top army officers .
Issues not held properly include recruitment ,  training ,  deployment ,  legal and regulatory deficiencies .
Muhoozi Kainerugaba ,  Museveni's son ,  joined the military .
They see such accusations as attempts to sideline them .
We cannot eliminate it .
It was perfectly legal .
How can you ,  in this short time take on Museveni ?
Besigye appears to have failed to "turn discontent into votes" .
This November marked twenty years since Besigye penned his famous dossier .
Museveni took over Uganda in one thousand nine hundred eighty-six .
Besigye participated in political activities since the late seventies .
They toppled over and later succeed the Idi Amin regime .
At that time ,  Besigye was a Colonel in the Uganda People Defense Force .
The decision was made by the National Resistance Council .
The capriciousness of Museveni's rule .
Muhoozi joined the military with many of his close friends and associates .
Besigye said people are fed up with him .
An insider's view on how National Resistance Movement lost the broad base'

The cameras should be installed at the police station counters .
Police constructed a three-storeyed structure and also installed monitoring gadgets .
The commission was the end of the first phase of the installation of cameras .
Museveni's pushed for the closed-circuit television cameras .
The closed-circuit television cameras center is for monitoring police too .
Museveni was joined by other government officials like Chief Justice Bart Katureebe ,  Rebecca Kadaga .
The walk is being held in commemoration of the anti-corruption week in early December
The anti-corruption walk is also meant to mark one year .
Ugandans commenting on social media expressed dissatisfaction .
Ugandans scorned the piecemeal attempts at fighting corruption .
John Muhanguzi Kashaka may spend more time in jail .
Kashaka's conviction and sentence were jointly upheld with that of Henry Bamutura .
The Anti-corruption Court convicted the three in two thousand fourteen .
The said bicycles were to be used by parish and Local chairpersons .
The bicycles have never been delivered
However ,  the convicts challenged their respective sentences and conviction .
They also argued that the lower court is incorrect in law and fact .
My prosperity comes from others .
If I say my tribe ,  my tribe ,  it doesn't make sense .
Museveni emphasized the need for a united Uganda in particular .
The sixty-man delegation was on a five-day visit to the country .
The court holds Kashaka's ten-year jail sentence .
Joshua Cheptegei is the current ten-kilometer world champion .

Besigye's political honesty .
In attendance was Doctor Kizza Besigye ,  the leading pillar of the opposition in Uganda .
Besigye said Uganda Patriotic Movement lost in the one thousand nine hundred eighty elections .
Besigye said Rukikaire got the highest number of votes .
There are expectations to this rule .
However ,  overall political competition requires money everywhere even in the richest countries .
In poor countries ,  money gains greater significance because the electorate is ethnically diverse .

These types of men are irritating .
Someone ,  please tell me what this is ?
I was overwhelmed by his rudeness .
The man is wondering where I have gone .
He is so stupid to think that I can talk to him again .
